# GUI_FYP contains a very lengthy MATLAB script (~1000 lines), and would take too long to explain the full inner workings.
# I have briefly summarised the key points below.
# Clicking 'Run' opens a GUI prompting the user to load in data obtained from tissue samples using an ultrasonic transducer (Verasonics).
# B-mode images are generated, and the user is asked to highlight a region of interest.
# MATLAB will generate Quantitative Ultrasound images for various statistics (mean, scatterer diameter, acoustic concentration etc).
